/**
 * {@link ComponentMessage} that can be published (via {@link ComponentContext}
 * by components if certain functionality is restricted - typically because it's
 * a paid for function or because an approval process is pending or so.
 *
 * Typically the user interface will have special handling available for this
 * message type to guide him in the direction of unlocking the restricted
 * functionality.
 *
 * Publishing the message once per job should be sufficient. Dispatching of more
 * than one such message may be disregarded by the user interface.
 *
 * This class and {@link RestrictedFunctionalityException} are two ways to
 * archieve something quite similar. The main difference is that a
 * {@link RestrictedFunctionalityMessage} can be used in scenarios where a job
 * is allowed to finish with just a partially functional result (for instance a
 * transformer may change it's behaviour after the message is sent) whereas the
 * {@link RestrictedFunctionalityException} will cancel the job because the
 * functionality is simply unavailable or a partial result is not granted
 * either.
