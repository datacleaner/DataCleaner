/**
 * Represents a symbol/element in a token pattern. If for example the pattern is
 * "aaa@aaa.aa", then there will be 5 symbols:
 * <ul>
 * <li>aaa</li>
 * <li>@</li>
 * <li>aaa</li>
 * <li>.</li>
 * <li>aa</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * The token pattern symbol is different from a pattern in the way that it is
 * more abstract. A symbol will not retain the concrete values of most tokens.
 * Thus the information stored in a symbol will often be limited to:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>The TokenType</li>
 * <li>The length of the symbol</li>
 * <li>Metadata about the symbol such as: Is it a negativ number, is it
 * uppercase, does it contain decimals etc.</li>
 * </ul>
