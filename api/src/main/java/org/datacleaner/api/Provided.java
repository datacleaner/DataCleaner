/**
 * Methods and fields with the @Provided annotation are used to let component
 * retrieve service-objects such as persistent collections, the current
 * SchemaNavigator or DataContext.
 *
 * This features ensures separation of concerns: The framework will make sure
 * that persistence is handled and the bean-developer will not have to worry
 * about memory problems related to his/her collection(s).
 *
 * Additionally Analyzerbeans can use the @Provided annotation to inject a
 * SchemaNavigator in order to perform metadata-based analysis. A DataContext
 * can also be injected, but this is generally discouraged for normal use-cases
 * since it will either be provided with the run(...)-method if the AnalyzerBean
 * is an ExploringAnalyzer or be out of scope if the AnalyzerBean is a
 * RowProcessingAnalyzer. For some use-cases it is helpful though, for example
 * initialization that requires some simple querying.
 *
 * Valid types for @Provided annotated fields and method arguments are:
 * <ul>
 * <li>List</li>
 * <li>Set</li>
 * <li>Map</li>
 * <li>org.datacleaner.storage.CollectionFactory</li>
 * <li>org.datacleaner.storage.RowAnnotationFactory</li>
 * <li>org.eobjecta.analyzer.util.SchemaNavigator</li>
 * <li>org.apache.metamodel.DataContext</li>
 * </ul>
 * Generic/parameterized types for the List, Set or Map can be any of:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Boolean</li>
 * <li>Byte</li>
 * <li>Short</li>
 * <li>Integer</li>
 * <li>Long</li>
 * <li>Float</li>
 * <li>Double</li>
 * <li>Character</li>
 * <li>String</li>
 * <li>Byte[] or byte[]</li>
 * </ul>
