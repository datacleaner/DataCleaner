/**
 * Annotation used to override the default component distribution and clustering
 * model. Any component (transformer, filter or analyzer) with this annotation
 * can define whether or not it can be distributed in a server cluster or not. A
 * distributed component will have multiple instances, all with the same
 * configuration. But since there are more instances, naturally they need to be
 * either stateless or have a state-logic which supports separate execution.
 *
 * The default behaviour of the components is:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>Transformers and Filters are by default distributed. The rationale behind
 * this default value is that the invoked methods (transform(...) and
 * categorize(...)) both return their results immidiately and thus a stateless
 * implementation will be the normal scenario.</li>
 * <li>Analyzers are by default <i>not</i> distributed. The rationale behind
 * this default value is that analyzers are expected to build up it's result
 * during execution and thus will typically be stateful. If a Analyzer is to be
 * distributed, it needs, or it's {@link AnalyzerResult} class needs, to specify
 * a {@link AnalyzerResultReducer} value for the {@link #reducer()} field.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * @see Filter
 * @see Transformer
 * @see Analyzer
