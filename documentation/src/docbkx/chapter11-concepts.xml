			<para>In this chapter we will try to define how we see the concepts
				and terms surrounding the environment(s) around DataCleaner.

			<para>Although these terms have no strict definitions, you can use
				this chapter as a guide, at least for the scope of how to use and
				what to expect from DataCleaner in relation to the described topics.
			</para>
			<para>As a lot of the statements in this chapter are in deed
				subjective or based upon personal experience, we encourage everyone

		<title>What is data quality (DQ)?</title>
		<para>Data Quality (DQ) is a concept and a business term covering the
			quality of the data used for a particular purpose. Often times the DQ
			term is applied to the quality of data used in business decisions but
			it may also refer to the quality of data used in research, campaigns,
			processes and more.
		</para>
		<para>Working with Data Quality typically varies a lot from project to
			project, just as the issues in the quality of data vary a lot.
			Examples of data quality issues include:
		</para>
		<orderedlist>
			<listitem>
				Completeness of data
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				Correctness of data
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				Duplication of data
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				Uniformedness/standardization of data
			</listitem>
		</orderedlist>
		<para>A less technical definition of high-quality data is, that data
			are of high quality "if they are fit for their intended uses in
			operations, decision making and planning" (J. M. Juran).
		</para>

		<para>a data quality analysis (DQA) is the (human) process of
			examining
			the quality of data for a particular process or
			organization. The DQA
			includes both technical and non-technical
			elements. For example, to
			do a good DQA you will probably need to talk
			to users, business
			people, partner organizations and maybe customers.
			This is needed to
			asses what the goal of the DQA should be.
		</para>
		<para>From a technical viewpoint the main task in a DQA is the data
			profiling activity, which will help you discover and measure the
			current state of affairs in the data.
		</para>

	<section id="what_is_data_profiling">
		<title>What is data profiling?</title>
		<para>Data profiling is the activity of investigating a datastore to
			create a 'profile' of it. With a profile of your datastore you will
			be a lot better equipped to actually use and improve it.
		</para>
		<para>
			The way you do profiling often depends on whether you already
			have
			some ideas about the quality of the data or if you're not
			experienced
			with the datastore at hand. Either way we recommend an
			<emphasis>explorative</emphasis>
			approach, because even though you think there are only a certain
			amount of issues you need to look for, it is our experience (and
			reasoning behind a lot of the features of DataCleaner) that it is
			just as important to check those items in the data that you think are
			correct! Typically it's cheap to include a bit more data into your
			analysis and the results just might surprise you and save you time!
		</para>
		<para>DataCleaner comprises (amongst other aspects) a desktop
			application for doing data profiling on just about any kind of
			datastore.
		</para>

	<section id="what_is_datastore">
		<title>What is a datastore?</title>
		<para>
			A datastore is the place where data is stored. Usually
			enterprise data
			lives in relational databases, but there are numerous
			exceptions to
			that rule.
		</para>
		<para>
			To comprehend different sources of data, such as
			databases,
			spreadsheets, XML files and even standard business
			applications, we
			employ the umbrella term
			<emphasis>datastore</emphasis>
			. DataCleaner is capable of retrieving data from a very wide range of
			datastores. And furthermore, DataCleaner can update the data of most
			of these datastores as well.
		</para>
		<para>
			A datastore can be created in the UI or via
			<link linkend="chapter_configuration_file"> the configuration file</link>
			.
			You can create a datastore from any type of source such
			as:
			CSV,
			EXCEL, Oracle Database,MySQL, etc.

		<section>
			<subtitle>Composite datastore</subtitle>
			<para>
				A
				<emphasis>composite</emphasis>
				datastore contains
				<emphasis>multiple datastores</emphasis>
				. The main advantage of a composite datastore is that it allows you
				to analyze and process data from multiple
				sources in the same job.
			</para>

	<section id="what_is_data_monitoring">
		<title>What is data monitoring?</title>
		<para>We've argued that data profiling is ideally an explorative
			activity. Data monitoring typically isn't! The measurements that you
			do when profiling often times needs to be continuously checked so
			that your improvements are enforced through time. This is what data
			monitoring is typically about.
		</para>
		<para>Data monitoring solutions comes in different shapes and sizes.
			You can set
			up your own bulk of scheduled jobs that run every night.
			You can
			build alerts around it that send you emails if a particular
			measure
			goes beyond it's allowed thresholds, or in some cases you can
			attempt
			ruling out the issue entirely by applying First-Time-Right
			(FTR)
			principles that validate data at entry-time. eg. at data
			registration
			forms and more.
		</para>
		<para>As of version 3, DataCleaner now also includes a monitoring web
			application, dubbed "DataCleaner monitor". The monitor is a server
			application that supports orchestrating and scheduling of jobs, as
			well as exposing metrics through web services and through interactive
			timelines and reports. It also supports the configuration and
			job-building process through wizards and management pages for all the
			components of the solution. As such, we like to say that the
			DataCleaner monitor provides a is a good
			foundation for the
			infrastructure needed in a Master Data Management
			hub.
		</para>

	<section id="what_is_mdm">
		<title>What is master data management (MDM)?</title>
		<para>Master data management (MDM) is a very broad term and is seen
			materialized in a variety of ways. For the scope of this document it
			serves more as a context of data quality than an activity that we
			actually target with DataCleaner per-se.
		</para>
		<para>The overall goals of MDM is to manage the important data of an
			organization. By "master data" we refer to "a single version of the
			truth", ie. not the data of a particular system, but for example all
			the customer data or product data of a company. Usually this data is
			dispersed over
			multiple datastores, so an important part of MDM
			is the
			process of unifying the data into a single model.
		</para>
		<para>Obviously another of the very important issues to handle in MDM
			is
			the quality of data. If you simply gather eg. "all customer data"
			from all systems in an organization, you will most likely see a lot
			of data quality issues. There will be a lot of duplicate entries,
			there will be variances in the way that customer data is filled,
			there will be different identifiers and even different levels of
			granularity for defining "what is a customer?". In the context of
			MDM, DataCleaner can serve as the engine to cleanse, transform and
			unify data from multiple datastores into the single view of the
			master data.
