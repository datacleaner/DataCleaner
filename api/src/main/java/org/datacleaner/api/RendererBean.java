/**
 * Annotation used to mark a class as a renderer. Mostly renderers are used for
 * AnalyzerResults, but can also be used as a UI representation of eg.
 * properties, components and more.
 *
 * Renderers are grouped together by rendering formats, which are defined by the
 * parameter to this annotation. This makes it possible to combine renderers for
 * particular result types and for particular output formats such as HTML,
 * Swing, clear text, XML etc.
 *
 * Renderers are resolved by combining the rendering format with the best
 * fitting output type defined by the Renderer interface.
 *
 * The configuration of renderer beans are not standardized since they target
 * very different situations. A RendererFactory is used to retrieve
 * perform instantiation and initialization of a renderer, so any life cycle
 * steps pertaining to renderer initialization and more is dependent on the
 * usage of the RendererFactory.
