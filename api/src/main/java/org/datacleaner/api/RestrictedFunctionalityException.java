/**
 * An exception that {@link Component}s can throw when certain functionality is
 * restricted - typically because it's a paid for function or because an
 * approval process is pending or so.
 *
 * Typically the user interface will have special handling available for this
 * exception type to guide him in the direction of unlocking the restricted
 * functionality.
 *
 * This class and {@link RestrictedFunctionalityMessage} are two ways to
 * archieve something quite similar. The main difference is that a
 * {@link RestrictedFunctionalityMessage} can be used in scenarios where a job
 * is allowed to finish with just a partially functional result (for instance a
 * transformer may change it's behaviour after the message is sent) whereas the
 * {@link RestrictedFunctionalityException} will cancel the job because the
 * functionality is simply unavailable or a partial result is not granted
 * either.
