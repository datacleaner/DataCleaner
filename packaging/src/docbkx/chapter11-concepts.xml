			<para>In this chapter we will try to define how we see the concepts
				and terms surrounding the environment(s) around DataCleaner.</para>
			<para>Although these terms have no strict definitions, you can use
				this chapter as a guide, at least for the scope of how to use and
				what to expect from DataCleaner in relation to the described topics.
			</para>
			<para>As a lot of the statements in this chapter are in deed
				subjective or based upon personal experience, we encourage everyone
				to provide their feedback and to contribute corrections/improvements
				to it.</para>

		<title>What is Data Quality (DQ)?</title>
		<para>Data Quality (DQ) is a concept and a business term covering the
			quality of the data used for a particular purpose. Often times the DQ
			term is applied to the quality of data used in business decisions but
			it may also refer to the quality of data used in research, campaigns,
			processes and more.</para>
		<para>Working with Data Quality typically varies a lot from project to
			project, just as the issues in the quality of data vary a lot.
			Examples of data quality issues include:</para>
		<orderedlist>
			<listitem>
				Completeness of data
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				Correctness of data
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				Duplication of data
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				Uniformedness/standardization of data
			</listitem>
		</orderedlist>
		<para>A less technical definition of high-quality data is, that data
			are of high quality "if they are fit for their intended uses in
			operations, decision making and planning" (J. M. Juran).</para>

	<section id="what_is_mdm">
		<title>What is Master Data Management (MDM)?</title>
		<para>Master Data Management (MDM) is a very broad term and is seen
			materialized in a variety of ways. For the scope of this document it
			serves more as a context of data quality than an activity that we
			actually target per-se.</para>
		<para>The overall goals of MDM is to manage the important data of an
			organization. By "master data" we refer to "a single version of the
			truth", ie. not the data of a particular system, but for example all
			the customer data of a company.</para>
		<para>Obviously one of the very important issues to handle in MDM is
			the quality of data. If you simply gather eg. "all customer data"
			from all systems in an organization, you will most likely see a lot
			of data quality issues. There will be a lot of duplicate entries,
			there will be variances in the way that customer data is filled out,
			there will be different identifiers and even different levels of
			granularity for defining "what is a customer?".</para>
	</section>

	<section id="what_is_data_quality_analysis">
		<title>What is Data Quality Analysis (DQA)?</title>
		<para>Data Quality Analysis (DQA) is the (human) process of examining
			the quality of data for a particular process or organization. The DQA
			includes both technical and non-technical elements. For example, to
			do a good DQA you will probably need to talk to users, business
			people, partner organizations and maybe customers. This is needed to
			asses what the goal of the DQA should be.</para>
		<para>From a technical viewpoint the main task in a DQA is the data
			profiling activity, which will help you discover and measure the
			current state of affairs in the data.</para>
	</section>

	<section id="what_is_data_profiling">
		<title>What is Data Profiling?</title>
		<para>Data Profiling is the activity of investigating a datastore to
			create a 'profile' of it. With a profile of your datastore you will
			be a lot better equipped to actually improve it.</para>
		<para>
			The way you do profiling often depends on whether you already
			have
			some ideas about the quality of the data or if you're not
			experienced
			with the datastore at hand. Either way we recommend an
			<emphasis>explorative</emphasis>
			approach, because even though you think there are only a certain
			amount of issues you need to look for, it is our experience (and
			reasoning behind a lot of the features of DataCleaner) that it is
			just as important to check those items in the data that you think are
			correct! Typically it's cheap to include a bit more data into your
			analysis and the results just might surprise you and save you time!
		</para>
	</section>

	<section id="what_is_data_quality_monitoring">
		<title>What is Data Quality Monitoring?</title>
		<para>We've argued that Data Profiling is ideally an explorative
			activity. Data Quality Monitoring isn't! The measurements that you do
			when profiling often times needs to be continuously checked so that
			your improvements are enforced through time. This is what Data
			Quality Monitoring is about.</para>
		<para>Data Quality Monitoring comes in different shapes and sizes. You
			can set up your own bulk of scheduled jobs that run every night. You
			can build alerts around it that send you emails if a particular
			measure goes beyond it's allowed thresholds, or in some cases you can
			attempt ruling out the issue entirely by applying First-Time-Right
			(FTR) principles that validate data at entry-time. eg. at data
			registration forms and more.
		</para>

	<section id="what_is_open_source">
		<title>What is Open Source software?</title>
		<para>That software is Open Source software basically means that the
			software is licensed under a license that gives you the right to use
			it (and it's source code) freely. But there are of course some
			limitations to these rights: First and foremost you cannot sell the
			software
			to a third party for money. In the case of DataCleaner it
			also means
			that if you modify or enhance the product, then you have to
			contribute back to the community your modifications. The idea here is
			that we should cooperate on building great software and that we
			should make this great software available to anyone for everybody's
			benefit.</para>
		<para>
			So what
			<emphasis>can</emphasis>
			you do with it? You can use it for any purpose you'd like. You can
			even include it in a software bundle that you sell for money - but
			you can only sell the bundle, not DataCleaner as such.
