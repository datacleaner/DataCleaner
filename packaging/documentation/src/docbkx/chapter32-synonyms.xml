	<title>Synonyms (aka. Synonym catalogs)</title>

	<chapterinfo>
		<abstract>
			<para>Synonym catalogs are used to replace and standardize values to
				their master terms, in order to avoid multiple terms for the same
				real
				world thing.
			</para>

			<para>There are many real life examples of synonyms that make for
				messy
				data, for example:
			</para>

			<orderedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para>Company and brand names, like "Coca-Cola", "Coca cola" and
						"Coke".
					</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>Titles, like "Doctor", "Dr." and "Doc"</para>
				</listitem>
			</orderedlist>

			<para>In the following sections we will describe how to set up
				synonym
				catalogs that can be used in a variety of ways to standardize your
				database.

		<title>Text file synonym catalog</title>
		<para>A text file synonym catalog is the easiest and often also the
			fastest way to perform synonym replacement. Simply create a text file
			with content in a format, where the master term is succeeded with a
			comma-separated list of synonyms, like this:
		</para>
		<programlisting>
			M,Male,Man,Guy,Boy
			F,Female,Woman,Girl
		</programlisting>
		<para>In the above example, most typical gender tokens will be
			replaced with either "M" or "F".
		</para>

		<title>Datastore synonym catalog</title>
		<para>If your synonyms are located in a database or another type of
			datastore, then you can also create synonym catalogs based on this.
		</para>
		<para>Datastore synonym catalogs allow you to specify a single master
			term column and multiple synonym columns. The synonym catalog will
			look then find synonym matches by searching/querying the datastore.
