	<chapterinfo>
		<abstract>
			<para>With transformations (accessible through the 'Transform' button
				in the main window) you can pre- and postprocess your data as part
				of
				your DQ project.
			</para>
			<para>Technically speaking there are two kinds of transformations:
				Transformers and Filters. Transformers are used to extract, generate
				or refine data (new columns and sometimes also new rows), whereas
				filters are used to limit the dataset. In previous version (2.0 -
				2.4)
				of DataCleaner filters and transformers were completely
				separated
				concepts, also in the user interface.
			</para>
			<para>There's quite a lot of transformations available in
				DataCleaner,
				more than will be feasible to describe all in detail. This chapter
				provides a documentation for some of the essential ones.

	<section id="table_lookup_transformer">
		<title>Table lookup</title>
		<para>The table lookup transformer allows you to look up values in a
			different table. Any amount of columns can be used for mapping
			(lookup conditioning) and for outputting (the outcome of the lookup).
		</para>
		<para>The configuration screen for the table lookup transformer looks
			like this:
		</para>
		<mediaobject>
			<imageobject>
				<imagedata fileref="transformer_reference_table_lookup.jpg"
					format="JPG" scalefit="1" />
			</imageobject>
		</mediaobject>
		<para>To make the mapping you need to select the target datastore,
			schema and table names. Once selected you will be able to select
			which columns to use for condition setting when looking up values.
		</para>
		<para>The semantics of the Table lookup are close to the semantics
			of a
			LEFT JOIN. If no lookup value is found, nulls will be returned.
			However, if multiple records are found to match the conditions, only
			the first will be returned.
		</para>
		<para>Note that the Table lookup will use a cache for looking up
			values, to avoid querying the target table for every incoming value.
		</para>

	<section id="synonym_lookup_transformer">
		<title>Synonym lookup</title>
		<para>
			The Synonym lookup transformation is a critical part of DataCleaner's
			ability to standardize and cleanse data. Using this component you can
			look up values in a
			<link linkend="synonym_catalogs">synonym catalog</link>
			and have it replaced with it's master term, if it is found to be a
			synonym.
		</para>
		<para>Below is a screenshot of the synonym lookup's configuration
			panel:
		</para>
		<mediaobject>
			<imageobject>
				<imagedata fileref="transformer_reference_synonym_lookup.png"
					format="PNG" scalefit="1" />
			</imageobject>
		</mediaobject>
		<para>
			The configuration of the Synonym lookup is simple:
		</para>
		<orderedlist>
			<listitem>
				<para>Select the column to apply the lookup function to.</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>Use the 'Retain original value' option to determine if
					unmatched values (non-synonyms) should be retained or if a null
					value should be returned if there is no match.
				</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>Select the synonym catalog to use for lookups.</para>
			</listitem>
		</orderedlist>

		<para>
			If your synonym catalog contains all the allowed values for a
			particula column, it can be a good idea to uncheck the 'Retain
			original value' checkbox and then do a simple null-check on the
			resulting output column. If null values are found, it's because there
			are values in the column that the synonym catalog is not able to
			standardize.
		</para>

	<section id="javascript_transformer">
		<title>JavaScript transformer</title>
		<para>The JavaScript transformer allows the user to define his/her own
			script which can
			perform rather intricate things like conditioning,
			looping. It can also be
			used as a
			useful way to express small business
			rules.
		</para>
		<para>For this documentation, a complete reference of JavaScript is
			out of scope. But we will show a few examples and more importantly
			talk about the available variables and their types.
		</para>
		<para>The JavaScript transformer returns a single string. The entered
			script should provide this string as the last line of the script.
			This is why the template script is as follows (so you can just
			implement the eval() function):
		</para>
		<programlisting>
			function&#160;eval() {
			&#160;&#160;&#160;return&#160;\"hello&#160;\"&#160;+&#160;values[0];
			}
			eval();
		</programlisting>

					<row>
						<entry>values</entry>
						<entry>
							<para>An array of all values in the row (as mapped by the
								"Columns" property).
							</para>
							<para>Using "values" you can reference eg. the first and third
								values like this:
							</para>
							<programlisting>
								var first = values[0];
								var third = values[2];
							</programlisting>
							<para>Note that JavaScript arrays are 0-based.</para>
							<para>Instead of indexes you can also reference by column name,
								like this:
							</para>
							<programlisting>
								var idValue = values["id"];
							</programlisting>

						</entry>
					</row>
					<row>
						<entry>
							<emphasis>column_name</emphasis>
							*
						</entry>
						<entry>
							<para>
								Any column name that is also a valid JavaScript and
								<emphasis>not</emphasis>
								a reserved variable name will also be added directly to the
								scope of the script as a variable. For example, if you have two
								columns, FIRST_NAME and LAST_NAME, you can concatenate them
								easily, like this:
							</para>
							<programlisting>var fullname = FIRST_NAME + " " + LAST_NAME;
							</programlisting>
						</entry>
					</row>
					<row>
						<entry>out</entry>
						<entry>
							<para>A reference to the system console's "out" stream. If
								running DataCleaner with the console visible, you can print
								messages to the console, like this:
							</para>
							<programlisting>out.println("Value: " + values[0]);
							</programlisting>
						</entry>
					</row>
					<row>
						<entry>log</entry>
						<entry>
							<para>A reference to the logging subsystem. Logging can be
								configured and log messages are stored in files, which makes it
								a bit more flexible than simply using "out". Here's how you
								write a few log messages with varying severities:
							</para>
							<programlisting>
								log.debug("This&#160;is&#160;a&#160;DEBUG&#160;message,&#160;it&#160;will&#160;probably&#160;be&#160;disregarded");
								log.info("This&#160;is&#160;a&#160;INFO&#160;message,&#160;it&#160;will&#160;probably&#160;be&#160;written&#160;to&#160;the&#160;logs");
								log.warn("This&#160;is&#160;a&#160;WARN&#160;message,&#160;it&#160;will&#160;most&#160;likely&#160;be&#160;written&#160;to&#160;the&#160;logs");
								log.error("This&#160;is&#160;a&#160;ERROR&#160;message,&#160;it&#160;will&#160;almost&#160;certainly&#160;be&#160;written&#160;to&#160;the&#160;logs");
