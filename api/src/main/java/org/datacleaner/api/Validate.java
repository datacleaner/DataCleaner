/**
 * Annotation that marks method as a validation method. Use this annotation if
 * you want to validate property values before initialization.
 *
 * The @Initialize annotation can be used on methods in the following component
 * types:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>AnalyzerBeans</li>
 * <li>TransformerBeans</li>
 * <li>FilterBeans</li>
 * <li>Dictionaries</li>
 * <li>SynonymCatalog</li>
 * <li>StringPattern</li>
 * <li>... and custom configuration elements, such as custom datastores and
 * custom task runners (in which case the semantics are a bit different - they
 * will only be validated once, just after loading the configuration).</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * The method is invoked after any @Configured and @Provided methods/fields are
 * invoked/assigned but before initialization and any business methods (such as
 * run(...) on an analyzer) are invoked.
 *
 * Validation methods should be repeatable and rather lightweight, since they
 * might be called multiple times on any single component.
