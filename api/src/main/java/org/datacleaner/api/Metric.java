/**
 * Annotation used to mark a getter-method as a retrieval mechanism for
 * {@link AnalyzerResult} metrics.
 *
 * A metric is an exposed number value which can be used to get summary
 * statistics of a particular result. This mechanism is used to allow
 * applications to compare results over time, by comparing their metrics.
 *
 * This annotation should be used for methods that conform to these
 * restrictions:
 * <ul>
 * <li>The return type must be a {@link Number} or a subtype of {@link Number},
 * including primitive/unboxed types. Alternatively it is possible to return an
 * {@link ParameterizableMetric} instance which allow the consumer to get more
 * metadata about the metrics parameter values.</li>
 * <li>The method can optionally have an {@link InputColumn} parameter, if the
 * metric contains different values for different analyzed columns.</li>
 * <li>The method can optionally have a String parameter, if the metric
 * furthermore takes a user-defined query parameter.</li>
 * <li>Except for the above mentioned exceptions, the method must not have any
 * parameters.</li>
 * </ul>
