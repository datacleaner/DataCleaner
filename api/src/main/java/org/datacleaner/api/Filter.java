/**
 * Interface for a {@link Component} that filters/categorizes rows.
 *
 * See {@link Component} for general information about all components. Like all
 * components, {@link Analyzer} require a {@link Named} annotation in order to
 * be discovered.
 *
 * A {@link Filter} will process incoming rows and label them with a category. A
 * category is defined as a value in an enum. When a row is categorized, this
 * category can then be used to set up a requirement for succeeding row
 * processing.
 *
 * A sub-interface of Filter exists, {@link QueryOptimizedFilter}, which allows
 * filter functionality to be pushed down to the query in certain circumstances
 * where it is desirable to do so. Also check out the {@link Optimizeable}
 * annotation which may be useful when applying {@link QueryOptimizedFilter}.
 *
 * @param <C>
 *            an enum type with the available categories
