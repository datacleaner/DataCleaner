/**
 * Interface for {@link Component}s that transform data before analysis.
 *
 * See {@link Component} for general information about all components. Like all
 * components, {@link Analyzer} require a {@link Named} annotation in order to
 * be discovered.
 *
 * A {@link Transformer} will process incoming rows and produce new fields which
 * are appended onto the existing rows. The {@link #transform(InputRow)} method
 * will be invoked on the {@link Transformer} for each row in a data stream.
 *
 * While the above description covers most common usage of the transformer
 * interface there are a few ways to build even more advanced transformations.
 *
 * Transformers can inject an {@link OutputRowCollector} in order to output
 * multiple records. The transform method should in such a case return null.
 * This also allows a {@link Transformer} to completely <i>swallow</i> a record,
 * not producing any output row for it, mean that it will not travel further in
 * the data stream. In many cases that's not a good thing (you might rather want
 * to build a {@link Filter} then) but it is possible.
