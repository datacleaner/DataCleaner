/**
 * Annotation that marks method as an initializing method. Use this annotation
 * if you need to initialize the state of a bean before it starts executing a
 * job.
 *
 * The @Initialize annotation can be used on methods in the following component
 * types:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>AnalyzerBeans</li>
 * <li>TransformerBeans</li>
 * <li>FilterBeans</li>
 * <li>Dictionary</li>
 * <li>SynonymCatalog</li>
 * <li>StringPattern</li>
 * <li>... and custom configuration elements, such as custom datastores and
 * custom task runners (in which case the semantics are a bit different - they
 * will only be initialized once, just after loading the configuration).</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * The method is invoked after any @Configured and @Provided methods/fields are
 * invoked/assigned but before any business methods (such as run(...) on an
 * analyzer) are invoked.
 *
 * For distributed execution, the {@link #distributed()} property will be
 * consulted to determine if the initialization methods should be executed on
 * all nodes or just on a single (typically master) node, before distribution.
 *
 * {@link Initialize} is often used in conjunction with the {@link Close}
 * annotation.
 *
 * @see Close
