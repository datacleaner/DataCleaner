/**
 * Annotation used for {@link Configured} properties that are mapped to another
 * {@link Configured} property.
 *
 * Usually the way this works by indicating that two array properties are
 * connected/mapped together. One property would contain an array of
 * {@link InputColumn}s and the other would be an array of Strings, enums or
 * something else. The second would then be mapped to the first, making it
 * possible for each input column to "have" a String or a enum value mapped.
 *
 * Another way that properties may be mapped is by hierarchical structure or
 * dependency. For instance, a {@link ColumnProperty} may be mapped to a
 * {@link TableProperty} which indicates that the column should exist within the
 * table.
